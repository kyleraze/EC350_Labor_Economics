# Theory in a data-driven world?

&gt; **The theory of economics** does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is **a method rather than a doctrine**, an apparatus of the mind, **a technique of thinking** which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions. &lt;br&gt; .right[&amp;mdash; John Maynard Keynes]

.bigger[**Why theory? We value what is useful. And theory is useful.**]

- .hi-pink[Theory can inform us of important parameters and their roles]
- .hi-pink[Theory relates seemingly disparate problems]
- .hi-pink[Theory provides a method for solving problems]
- .hi-pink[Theory is an antidote to introspection]
- .hi-pink[Economics is amenable to experimental verification]

# Theory in a data-driven world?

It is **a method rather than a doctrine**, an apparatus of the mind, **a technique of thinking** which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions. &lt;br&gt; .right[&amp;mdash; John Maynard Keynes]


Arguably, **we want to** be able to **identify which margins matter** and **identify their importance** when we can.

**We should therefore be comfortable with the following structure:**

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Q:** .ul[&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;]**?**

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **A:** .pink[It depends.] In particular, it depends on .ul[&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;], .ul[&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;], and .ul[&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;].

# Theory in a data-driven world?

## By definition:

&gt; **An explanation** for some phenomenon that is based on observation, experimentation, and reasoning.

&gt; A logical statement or **a testable model** of the manner in which phenomena interact.

&gt; A structured prediction that is capable of being tested through experimentation or otherwise **falsifiable through empirical observation**.

---
# Theory in a data-driven world?

## What makes theory valuable?

**Q:** What do we mean by "good in theory, but lousy in practice?"

--

- Such statements are misplaced, as theory's only value is in **how well it works in practice!**
- Let's not say this anymore?


--

## Factors to consider?

**Refutability** 

- The theory could, in principle, be wrong. Otherwise, it is without value.
- Economists/scientists seek to make statements that could be wrong, but are repeatedly shown to be consistent with the facts.

- Such statements are misplaced, as theory's only value is in **how well it works in practice!**
- Let's not say this anymore?

## Factors to consider?

**Predictive power** 

- A theory is valuable insofar as it predicts behavior well.

# Theory in a data-driven world?

**Q:** What do we mean by "good in theory, but lousy in practice?"

- Such statements are misplaced, as theory's only value is in **how well it works in practice!**
- Let's not say this anymore?

## Factors to consider?

**Simplicity** 

- *All else equal*, simpler theory is more valuable.

---
# Theory in a data-driven world?

**Caveat 1: A theory does not imply its converse.**

Observing .hi-pink[B] does not guarantee that .hi-purple[A] is true. **Something else could have caused** .hi-pink[B]**.**

- Example: Just because .pink[you don't have a headache] doesn't mean that .purple[you took an Advil].
- Example: Just because .pink[you improved your exam score] doesn't mean that .purple[your attendance improved]. &lt;br&gt;
    

--

**Caveat 2: Science cannot prove that a theory is true.**

At best, science fails to refute a theory's postulates or predictions.

- Example: We will not prove that social assistance programs ("welfare") are good. Nor will we prove that social assistance programs are bad.

---
# Why is the *American dream* fading?

**Policy Question:** Why is a child's chance of climbing the income ladder decreasing in the United States?

- What can we do to reverse this trend?

Difficult to answer with historical data on macroeconomic trends.

- **That other things change over time makes it difficult** to separately identify the roles of alternative explanations

---
# Theoretical social science

Historically, the social sciences had **limited data** to study policy questions.

**The result?** Social sciences were .pink[theoretical] fields

- Some researchers developed .pink[mathematical models]
- Some developed .pink[qualitative theories]
- Both used their theories to make policy recommendations (*e.g.,* to improve upward mobility)

--

**The problem?** Without data, even falsifiable theories are never tested!

- Five researchers could have five different answers to the same question
- Can lead to a politicization of questions that, in principle, have scientific answers (*e.g.,* do minimum wage laws reduce employment?)

# The rise of empirical evidence

Today, the social sciences are increasingly **empirical** thanks to the growing availability of data and computational power.

- Gives us **the ability to test** existing theories
- Gives us **the ability to refine** theory to (i) better explain decision making and (ii) better fit real-world data

The social sciences have caught up to the natural sciences in terms of scientific rigor, arguably surpassing the natural sciences in sophistication.

- Given the complexity of human decision making, inability to experiment in controlled environments, *etc.*?

# Making *other-things-equal* comparisons

---
# *Other-things-equal* comparisons

**The policy?** In 2017, the University of Oregon started requiring first-year students to live on campus.

**The rationale?** First-year students who live on campus outperform those who live off campus.

- Average 2.super[nd]-year retention rate _5 percentage points higher_
- _80 percent more likely to graduate_ in four years
- GPA _0.13 points higher_

--

**Q:** Do these comparisons suggest that the policy will improve student outcomes?

--

**Q:** Do they describe the effect of living on campus?

**Q:** Do they describe *something else?*

---
# *Other-things-equal* comparisons

**Healthy skepticism** should leave us questioning the UO's interpretation.

- The **decision** to live on campus is likely related to family wealth and interest in school.
- Family wealth and interest in school are also related to academic achievement.


--



**The difference in outcomes** between those on and off campus **does not offer an *other-things-equal* comparison**.

- Without further evidence, one should not attribute the difference in outcomes to living on campus.
    - Not without considering those things that both (i) correlate with living on campus (*e.g.,* family wealth) and (ii) correlate with outcomes (*e.g.,* graduation)

---
# *Other-things-equal* comparisons

Statistical comparisons can only identify causal relationships between variables **when all other factors are "held constant."** 

- *Causal* relationship .mono[=] How a change in one variable *induces* a change in another

Economists have developed a *comparative advantage*.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] in understanding where **other-things-equal** comparisons can (and cannot) be made.

.footnote[.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] *Comparative advantage* .mono[=] Ability of an individual or group to perform an activity at lower cost relative to another individual or group.]

- Anyone can retort "_correlation doesn't imply causation!_"

## The objective

Identify the effect of a .hi[treatment] on an .hi[outcome].

## The ideal comparison

Ideally, we could calculate the **treatment effect** *for each individual* as

`$$Y_{1,i} - Y_{0,i}$$`

- `\(Y_{1,i}\)` is the outcome for person `\(i\)` when `\(i\)` receives the treatment
- `\(Y_{0,i}\)` is the outcome for person `\(i\)` when `\(i\)` does not receive the treatment
- Known as **potential outcomes**

# Randomized control trials 

## Overcoming selection bias

**The problem?** The existence of selection bias precludes making *other-things-equal* comparisons.

- To make valid comparisons that identify causal effects, we need to shut down the bias coming from selection.

--

**The solution?** Conduct an experiment!

- How? Assign treatment .hi-pink[randomly]
- Hence the name, .hi-pink[*randomized* control trial] (RCT)

---
# Randomized control trials 

## Example: Effect of de-worming on attendance

**Motivation:** Intestinal worms are common among children in less-developed countries. The symptoms of these parasites can keep school-aged children at home, disrupting human capital accumulation.

**Policy question:** Do school-based de-worming interventions provide a cost-effective way to increase school attendance? 

---
# Randomized control trials 

## Example: Effect of de-worming on attendance

**Research question:** How much do de-worming interventions increase school attendance?

**Q:** **Could we simply compare average attendance** among children with and without access to de-worming medication?

--

- **A:** If we're after the causal effect, probably not. (Why not?)


--

**Selection bias:** Families with access to de-worming medication probably have healthier children for other reasons, too (wealth, access to clean drinking water, *etc.*).

- **We can't make an *all-else-equal* comparison** .mono[--&gt;] in expectation, observed differences will deviate *systematically* from the ATE!

---
# Randomized control trials 

## Example: Effect of de-worming on attendance

**Solution:** Run an experiment.

--

Imagine an RCT where we have two groups:

- .hi-slate[Treatment:] Villages where children get de-worming medication in school.
- .hi-slate[Control:] Villages where children don't get de-worming medication in school (status quo).

--

By randomizing villages into .hi-slate[treatment] or .hi-slate[control], we will, on average, include all kinds of villages (poor _vs._ less poor, access to clean water _vs._ contaminated water, hospital _vs._ no hospital, *etc.*) in both groups.

--

*All else equal*!

# Randomized control trials 

## Example: Effect of de-worming on attendance

We can estimate the **causal effect** of de-worming on school attendance by **comparing the average attendance rates** in the .hi-pink[treatment group] (💊) with those in the .hi-purple[control group] (no 💊):

.center[.hi-pink[Treatment group attendance rate] .mono[-] .hi-purple[Control group attendance rate]]


--

**Result:** This was done in Kenya, where [attendance increased](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/deworming-schools-improves-attendance-and-benefits-communities-over-long-term) with the random assignment of treatment.

- 25-percent decrease in absenteeism at a cost of $0.60 per child
- Long term cost effectiveness: Additional 11.91 years of schooling per $100 spent on de-worming

.center[.hi-pink[Treatment group attendance rate] .mono[-] .hi-purple[Control group attendance rate]]

**Q:** Should we trust the results of the comparison? 

--

**A:** Even with healthy skepticism, we probably should? On average, randomly assigning treatment balances the treatment and control groups across other dimensions that could explain school attendance.

# Interpreting results

## Internal validity

Addresses the question, ***should we believe the study?***

A study has high **internal validity** if, within the context of the study, we are confident that one variable has a **causal** influence on the outcome of interest (*e.g.,*  there's **no selection bias**).

--

## External validity

Addresses the question, ***how far can we generalize the results of the study?***

A study has high **external validity** to the extent that the results **apply to other contexts** (not just the local environment that generated the results).

# *Thinking Fast and Slow*, Chicago edition

## Background

**Policy question:** How can we reduce violent crime among young men? 

**Research agenda:** What factors influence an individual's proclivity toward violent crime? 

- Self control? Social skills? Grit?
- Economic hardship?
- Police presesnce?
- Early chilhood education?
- Something else?

# *Thinking Fast and Slow*, Chicago edition

**Research question:** Can cognitive-behavioral therapy keep young men in school and out of trouble?

- Proposed mechanism: Automaticity.

--

**Experiment:** *Becoming a Man*

4804 young men in Chicago Public Schools randomly assigned to one of two groups:

- .hi-pink[Treatment group:] Group cognitive-behavioral therapy program during school (once per week for 1-2 school years)
- .hi-purple[Control group:] No intervention

--

A similar experiment was also conducted in the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.
