# Signaling

**Q:** Why do college graduates earn more than high-school graduates?

--

- They learn new skills that increase your productivity?
- They separate themselves from people who couldn't make it through college?
    - Getting through may correlate with productive attributes.
    
    
--

### **Asymmetric information**

One side of a market often has less information than the other.

- In the labor market, employers often have to "take a chance" on new employees&amp;mdash;they don't know exactly who is a good fit for a job.
- To separate those who would be a good fit for the job from those who wouldn't, employers can 1) rely on **signaling** by potential employees or 2) employ a **screening** test.

# Education as a signal of ability

The **Spence model**.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] posits that education can help higher-ability workers separate themselves from lower-ability workers when employers cannot directly observe ability.

- In contrast to models of human capital, the Spence model assumes that **education has no impact on productivity**.

.footnote[.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] Named after the economist Michael Spence, who developed the model in [Job Market Signaling](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1882010), *The Quarterly Journal of Economics* (1973).]

--


**The players?** 

1. High-ability workers
2. Low-ability workers
3. Employer
    - Willing to pay a premium for high-ability workers over low-ability workers.
    - But...unable to observe worker types.

# Education as a signal of ability

The **Spence model**.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] posits that education can help higher-ability workers separate themselves from lower-ability workers when employers cannot directly observe ability.

- In contrast to models of human capital, the Spence model assumes that **education has no impact on productivity**.

.footnote[.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] Named after the economist Michael Spence, who developed the model in [Job Market Signaling](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1882010), *The Quarterly Journal of Economics* (1973).]

**And their objectives?** 

1. High-ability workers **want to separate** themselves from low-ability workers.
2. Low-ability workers **want to pool** with high-ability workers.
3. Employer **wants to identify** worker **types**.


---
# Spence model

## **Setup**

If the employer could observe types, then they would pay a salary that corresponds to each individual's present value of lifetime productivity.

| Worker type | Proportion of population | Present value of lifetime productivity |
|:-----------:|:------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
| Low-ability | *q*                      | $250,000                               |
| High-ability| 1 .mono[-] *q*           | $350,000                               |

--

Workers know their ability, but the employer doesn't! .mono[--&gt;] **asymmetric information!**

---
# Spence model

## **Pooling equilibrium**

With asymmetric information, **the employer treats all workers the same**, paying an identical salary that averages the lifetime productivity of both groups: `$$\begin{align} \text{Salary} &amp;= \text{250,000} \times q + \text{350,000} \times (1 - q) \\ &amp;= \text{350,000} - \text{100,000} \times q \end{align}$$`

--

- **Low-ability workers are overpaid** and **high-ability workers are underpaid**.
- **The employer also suffers** because workers are not necessarily assigned to the appropriate job.


--

**Q:** Why can't a high-ability worker just tell the employer that they are highly-able?

--

**A:** Because **talk is cheap!**

- A low-ability worker can just as easily claim that they are highly-able!

---
# Spence model

## **Ability signaling**

High-ability workers have an incentive to provide **a credible signal** of their ability to employers.

- If employers learn their type, then they get a higher wage.


--

Likewise, employers have an incentive to **extract signals** that separate workers by ability.

- Knowing worker types allows employers to **avoid mismatches** between workers and jobs.


--

**Q:** When is a signal *credible*?

--

**A:** When it is sufficiently **costly!**

- Costly enough to discourage low-ability workers from pursuing.
- Cheap enough for high-ability workers to willingly pursue.


---
# Spence model

## **Separating equilibrium**

Employers can choose a level of education `\(\bar{e}\)` that separates low-ability types from high-ability types.

* Anyone with less education than `\(\bar{e}\)` .mono[--&gt;] low-ability.
* Anyone with `\(\bar{e}\)` or more education .mono[--&gt;] high-ability.


--

The existence of a separating equilibrium **requires that education is more costly for a low-ability worker** than for a high-ability worker.

- Both types face the same tuition rates, book prices, *etc.*
- But low-ability types pay more in extra tutoring, re-taking failed classes, additional stress, *etc.*


--

Assume that low-ability workers pay $30,000 per year and high-ability workers pay $20,000 per year.

## **Separating equilibrium**

Employers can choose a level of education `\(\bar{e}\)` that separates low-ability types from high-ability types.

* Anyone with less education than `\(\bar{e}\)` .mono[--&gt;] low-ability.
* Anyone with `\(\bar{e}\)` or more education .mono[--&gt;] high-ability.

The low-ability worker **will not obtain** `\(\bar{e}\)` if the low-ability wage exceeds the higher wage minus the cost of education: `$$\begin{align} \text{250,000} &amp;&gt; \text{350,000} - \text{30,000} \times \bar{e} \\ \bar{e} &amp;&gt; 3.33 \end{align}$$`

* Anyone with less education than `\(\bar{e}\)` .mono[--&gt;] low-ability.

The high-ability worker **will obtain** `\(\bar{e}\)` if the high-ability wage minus the cost of education exceeds the low-ability wage: `$$\begin{align} \text{350,000} - \text{20,000} \times \bar{e} &amp;&gt; \text{250,000}   \\ \bar{e} &amp;&lt; 5 \end{align}$$`

# Spence model

## **Separating equilibrium**

Employers can choose a level of education `\(\bar{e}\)` that separates low-ability types from high-ability types.

* Anyone with less education than `\(\bar{e}\)` .mono[--&gt;] low-ability.
* Anyone with `\(\bar{e}\)` or more education .mono[--&gt;] high-ability.

In our running example, the employer chooses 3.33 .mono[&lt;] `\(\bar{e}\)` .mono[&lt;] 5, which separates high-ability from low-ability workers.

- High-ability workers get `\(\bar{e}\)` years of education and earn a lifetime salary of $350,000.
- Low-ability workers get zero years of education and earn a lifetime salary of $250,000.

# Spence model

## **Implications?**

For the **role of education?**

--

- Under a pure signaling model, education is nothing more than a **sorting mechanism**. 
- You professor's job? Make sure A's only go to high-ability students.


--

For **economic efficiency?**

- On the one hand, **education is "wasteful"** in the sense that it doesn't increase productivity. 
- On the other hand, **education reduces worker mismatch** caused by asymmetric information.


---
# Spence model

## **Implications?**

For **you?**

--

- Taking difficult classes set you apart, *even if you don't learn anything*.
--

- Not all A's are created equal.
--

- Cheap talk on your résumé won't increase your odds of landing a job, at the margin. 
   - You're a *detail-oriented, self-motivated, team player*? Sure.

# Sheepskin effects

The empirical relationship between earnings and years of education **isn't smooth**.

- There are significant **"jumps"** in average earnings **where you'd expect them**&amp;mdash;12 years, 16 years, *etc.*.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]]
- *Holding years of education constant*, workers with a degree earn more than those without a degree, on average..super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;]]

.footnote[.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]]  Thomas Hungerford and Gary Solon (1987), [Sheepskin Effects in the Returns to Education](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1937919), *The Review of Economics and Statistics.*  &lt;br&gt; .super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;]] David A. Jaeger and Marianne E. Page (1996), [Degrees Matter: New Evidence on Sheepskin Effects in the Returns to Education](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2109960), *The Review of Economics and Statistics.*]

--

That is, the simple act of having obtained that piece of paper&amp;mdash;your degree&amp;mdash;seems to matter a lot.

**Q:** Does this provide evidence for signaling?

--

**A:** It's debatable, though the [more-convincing arguments](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2017/12/sheepskin-effects-signals-without.html) suggest that sheepskin effects are not evidence of pure signaling.

# Signaling *vs.* human capital

## **Discussion**

**Q.sub[1]:** Why do I make you take exams?

**Q.sub[2]:** Why do we give gifts?

**Q.sub[3]:** What is the purpose of initiation rituals (*e.g.,* to join a gang)?
