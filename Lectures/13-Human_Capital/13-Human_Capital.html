# Human Capital

### **What is it?**

Human capital is set of **acquired skills and experiences** that a worker brings into the labor market.

- **Increases productivity** beyond a worker's innate abilities
- Includes basic literacy and numeracy as well as more-advanced skills
- Non-transferable
- Varies in specificity (*e.g.,* knowing how to code *vs.* knowing how to code in an obscure language)


--

### **Why does it matter?**

Human capital is an important source of **economic growth** and **inequality**.

- Increasing human capital can improve living standards!
- Differences in human capital accumulation generate differences in earnings across workers.

**Q:** What do areas A, B, and C represent?

- Area A represents the **explicit cost** of college (tuition, books, *etc.*).
- Area B represents the **opportunity cost** of college (forgone earnings).
- Area C represents the monetary **returns to education**.

# The benefits of education

College is costly!

- Tuition, books, room and board, forgone earnings, stress, *etc.*


--



**Q:** Why did *you* **choose to incur the costs** of going to college? 

--

- To live the life of the mind?
- To increase your earnings potential?
- To expand your social network? 
- To accrue social prestige?
- To set yourself apart?
- To party?
- To find love?


--

While education may have consumption value, we will consider schooling decisions **as investments.**

---
# Education as investment

**Q:** When is it "worth it" to go to college?

- **Benefits?** Going to college causes us to **earn more later in life**.
- **Costs?** Going to college forces us to **forgo earnings now** (and pay tuition, *etc.*).


--

Evaluating this tradeoff requires us to compare dollar amounts spent and received in different time periods.

- To do this, we will use the idea of **present value**, which tells us how much an amount of money received in the future is **worth today**.

---
# Education as investment

## **Present value**

`$$\text{PV} = \dfrac{y}{(1 + r)^t}$$`

- `\(y\)` is the dollar amount received `\(t\)` periods in the future.
- `\(r\)` is the discount/interest rate.

**The idea?** Getting 100 dollars today is worth more today than getting 100 dollars next year.

- If you got 100 dollars today, you could invest it and end up with `\(100 \times (1 + r)\)` one year from now!

---
# Education as investment

## **Present value**

`$$\text{PV} = \dfrac{y}{(1 + r)^t}$$`

- `\(y\)` is the dollar amount received `\(t\)` periods in the future.
- `\(r\)` is the discount/interest rate.

**Q:** If the interest rate is 10 percent, what is the present value of receiving 1,000 dollars two years from now?

--

**A:** 826.45 dollars and 45 cents. `$$\begin{align} \text{PV} &amp;= \dfrac{y}{(1 + r)^t} = \dfrac{1000}{(1 + 0.1)^2} = \dfrac{1000}{1.1^2} = \dfrac{1000}{1.21} = 826.45  \end{align}$$`

class: clear-slide

**Example:** You are deciding whether to go back to school. 

- You just turned 60, and it would take you 2 years to finish a master's program, which would cost you 10,000 dollars per year.
- You currently earn 80,000 dollars per year. With a master's degree, you could earn 83,000. 
- Regardless of your decision, you are going to retire at 65.

**Q:** If your discount rate is 5 percent, will you choose to go back to school?

- Your discount rate increases?
- Your post-master's earnings increase?
- Tuition increases?
- You plan to postpone your retirement?

# Schooling decisions

## **The stopping rule**

**Q:** How does a worker choose the optimal.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] amount of schooling?

.footnote[.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] "Optimal" in the sense of maximizing the present value of lifetime earnings.]

--

**A:** A worker chooses the optimal amount of schooling `\(e^*\)` where the marginal rate of return equals the discount rate: `$$\text{MRR} = r$$`

--

- If `\(\text{MRR} &gt; r\)`, then schooling education would increase the present value of lifetime earnings.
- If `\(\text{MRR} &lt; r\)`, then the worker has "gone too far"&amp;mdash;she could had a higher present value of lifetime earnings if she had completed less schooling.
