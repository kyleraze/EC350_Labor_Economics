# What role should economists play?

---
# What role should economists play?

It will be important for us to separate our beliefs about **what is desirable** from what we believe to be **true or false**.

A proper economic analysis consists of **positive statements**.

- Statements that can be classified as **either true or false**


--

Economists try to avoid **normative statements** in their analysis.

- Statements that express a value judgment or *what ought to be*
- No matter how widely shared, value judgments are untestable&amp;mdash;not scientifically justifiable.


--

**Q:** Is there ever a role for the normative?

--

**A: Yes, of course**, but only to the extent that it is supported by positive statements.

***"The unemployment rate is 5.8 percent."***

--

- This is a .pink[positive statement]. The unemployment rate is either 5.8 percent or it is not 5.8 percent. &lt;br&gt;


--

***"The federal government should forgive all student loan debt."***

--

- This is a .purple[normative statement]. It expresses an opinion, and is not classifiable as true or false. &lt;br&gt;


--

***"By removing discriminatory barriers that had prevented Black citizens from voting, the Voting Rights Act facilitated an increase in public investment directed toward Black communities."***

--

- This is a .pink[positive statement].

# Race and Economic Opportunity

.bigger[**Research question:** Do Black children have lower incomes than White children who grew up in households with the same income?]

- If so, what can policymakers do about it?


.footnote[*Source:* Raj Chetty et al. (2020), [Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: An Intergenerational Perspective](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/2/711/5687353), *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*.]


--

**Motivation:** Large income disparities between Black and White Americans have persisted throughout US history.

- Why aren't gaps closing over time?


--

**Approach:** Use administrative data on children and their parents to compare adult outcomes for children who grew up in the same part of the income distribution.


---
# Race and Economic Opportunity

## Data

**Source:** Administrative records from the IRS and the Census Bureau (1989-2015) on 20 million children born between 1978 and 1983

- Individual-level data on race, income, marital status, incarceration, geographic location, *etc.*
- Ability to follow the same individuals over time and link them with their parents


--

**Main variables of interest:** Household income percentile ranks for .pink[children] and their .purple[parents]

- .pink[Child income rank] relative to other children in the same birth cohort
    - Measured when child is in their mid-30s
- .purple[Parent income rank] relative to other parents with children in the same birth cohort
    - Measured when child is between 11 and 22

**Q.sub[1]:** Whose experiences contribute most to the Black-White mobility gap? 

**Q.sub[2]:** How much can differences in family characteristics explain the Black-White mobility gap?

**Q.sub[3]:** How do neighborhoods shape differences in mobility across generations?

**Q.sub[4]:** What should we take away from the research?

**Q:** So...what is the value of **theory** in an increasingly data-driven world?


---
# Theory in a data-driven world?

&gt; **The theory of economics** does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is **a method rather than a doctrine**, an apparatus of the mind, **a technique of thinking** which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions. &lt;br&gt; .right[&amp;mdash; John Maynard Keynes]

.bigger[**We value what is useful. And theory is useful.**]

.bigger[**We value what is useful. And theory is useful.**]

.hi-pink[Theory can be a substitute for data]

- The absence of a counterfactual is fundamental to the challenge in identifying causal relationships. 
- Theory can provide structure to our guess work.

.bigger[**We value what is useful. And theory is useful.**]

.hi-pink[Theory can inform us of important parameters and their roles]

- What to look for, what to ask, what margins to follow up on?
- Particular elasticities? Interactions? Non-linearities?

.hi-pink[Theory relates seemingly disparate problems]

- Abstract theory&amp;mdash;stripping away the "irrelevant" details&amp;mdash;makes it apparent when the same choice problem is being implicated.
- The language of your "problems" may differ, but the underlying tradeoffs might be...identical!

.hi-pink[Economics is amenable to experimental verification]

&gt; *I expect that the interaction between theory and experimentation will continue to grow in the future. As economists become more comfortable with experimentation in the laboratory, they will also become better at identifying 'natural experiments' in real-world data. Such developments can only lead to better models of economic behavior.* &lt;br&gt; .right[&amp;mdash; Hal Varian (now Chief Economist at Google, writing as an economics professor in 1989)]

Arguably, **we want to** be able to **identify which margins matter** and **identify their importance** when we can.

**We should therefore be comfortable with the following structure:**

- If .purple[you attend class regularly] then .pink[you will earn a higher grade].


- If .purple[monitoring workers is costly] then .pink[firms will compensate workers based on performance].


- If .purple[the risk of dying from an overdose decreases] then .pink[the number of overdoses will increase]..super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]]

# Theory in a data-driven world?

## By definition:

&gt; **An explanation** for some phenomenon that is based on observation, experimentation, and reasoning.

&gt; A logical statement or **a testable model** of the manner in which phenomena interact.

&gt; A structured prediction that is capable of being tested through experimentation or otherwise **falsifiable through empirical observation**.

# Theory in a data-driven world?

## What makes theory valuable?

**Q:** What do we mean by "good in theory, but lousy in practice?"

--

- Such statements are misplaced, as theory's only value is in **how well it works in practice!**
- Let's not say this anymore?


--

## Factors to consider?

**Refutability** 

- The theory could, in principle, be wrong. Otherwise, it is without value.
- Economists/scientists seek to make statements that could be wrong, but are repeatedly shown to be consistent with the facts.

**Predictive power** 

- A theory is valuable insofar as it predicts behavior well.

- Such statements are misplaced, as theory's only value is in **how well it works in practice!**

**Simplicity** 

- *All else equal*, simpler theory is more valuable.

# Theory in a data-driven world?

**Caveat 1: A theory does not imply its converse.**

Observing **B** does not guarantee that **A** is true. **Something else could have caused B.**

- Example: More people catch colds in winter months than in summer months, but low temperatures do not cause colds.
- Example: Indoor temperatures are negatively correlated with the running time on furnaces, but furnaces do not cool houses. &lt;br&gt;
    

--

**Caveat 2: Science cannot prove that a theory is true.**

At best, science fails to refute a theory's postulates or predictions.

- Example: We will not prove that social assistance programs ("welfare") are good. Nor will we prove that social assistance programs are bad.
