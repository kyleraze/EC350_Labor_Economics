# What role should economists play?

---
# What role should economists play?

It will be important for us to separate our beliefs about **what is desirable** from what we believe to be **true or false**.

A proper economic analysis consists of **positive statements**.

- Statements that can be classified as **either true or false**


--

Economists try to avoid **normative statements** in their analysis.

- Statements that express a value judgment or *what ought to be*
- No matter how widely shared, value judgments are untestable&mdash;not scientifically justifiable.


--

**Q:** Is there ever a role for the normative?

--

**A: Yes, of course**, but only to the extent that it is supported by positive statements.


---
class: clear-slide

***"The unemployment rate is 5.8 percent."***

--

- This is a .pink[positive statement]. The unemployment rate is either 5.8 percent or it is not 5.8 percent. <br>


--

***"The federal government should forgive all student loan debt."***

--

- This is a .purple[normative statement]. It expresses an opinion, and is not classifiable as true or false. <br>


--

***"By removing discriminatory barriers that had prevented Black citizens from voting, the Voting Rights Act facilitated an increase in public investment directed toward Black communities."***

--

- This is a .pink[positive statement].

# Race and Economic Opportunity

.bigger[**Research question:** Do Black children have lower incomes than White children who grew up in households with the same income?]

- If so, what can policymakers do about it?


.footnote[*Source:* Raj Chetty et al. (2020), [Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: An Intergenerational Perspective](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/135/2/711/5687353), *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*.]


--

**Motivation:** Large income disparities between Black and White Americans have persisted throughout US history.

- Why do gaps continue to exist? 
- Why is it taking so long for gaps to close?


--

**Approach:** Use administrative data on children and their parents to compare adult outcomes for children who grew up in the same part of the income distribution.


---
# Race and Economic Opportunity

## Data

**Source:** Administrative records from the IRS and the Census Bureau (1989-2015) on 20 million children born between 1978 and 1983

- Individual-level data on race, income, marital status, incarceration, geographic location, *etc.*
- Ability to follow the same individuals over time and link them with their parents


--

**Main variables of interest:** Household income percentile ranks for .pink[children] and their .purple[parents]

- .pink[Child income rank] relative to other children in the same birth cohort
    - Measured when child is in their mid-30s
- .purple[Parent income rank] relative to other parents with children in the same birth cohort
    - Measured when child is between 11 and 22

**Q.sub[1]:** Whose experiences contribute most to the Black-White mobility gap? 

**Q.sub[2]:** How much can differences in family characteristics explain the Black-White mobility gap?

**Q:** So...what is the value of **theory** in an increasingly data-driven world?


---
# Theory in a data-driven world?

> **The theory of economics** does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is **a method rather than a doctrine**, an apparatus of the mind, **a technique of thinking** which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions. <br> .right[&mdash; John Maynard Keynes]

.bigger[**We value what is useful. And theory is useful.**]

.hi-pink[Theory can be a substitute for data]

- The absence of a counterfactual is fundamental to the challenge in identifying causal relationships. 
- Theory can provide structure to our guess work.

.bigger[**We value what is useful. And theory is useful.**]

.hi-pink[Theory can inform us of important parameters and their roles]

- What to look for, what to ask, what margins to follow up on?
- Particular elasticities? Interactions? Non-linearities?

.bigger[**We value what is useful. And theory is useful.**]

.hi-pink[Theory relates seemingly disparate problems]

- Abstract theory&mdash;stripping away the "irrelevant" details&mdash;makes it apparent when the same choice problem is being implicated.
- The language of your "problems" may differ, but the underlying tradeoffs might be...identical!

.hi-pink[Theory is an antidote to introspection]

- Most people get their economic beliefs from introspection and their personal experience&mdash;the same place that they get their beliefs about most things.
- Economic theory&mdash;and indeed science in general&mdash;can serve as an antidote to this kind of introspection.

Arguably, **we want to** be able to **identify which margins matter** and **identify their importance** when we can.

**We should therefore be comfortable with the following structure:**

# Theory in a data-driven world?

## By definition:

> **An explanation** for some phenomenon that is based on observation, experimentation, and reasoning.

> A logical statement or **a testable model** of the manner in which phenomena interact.

> A structured prediction that is capable of being tested through experimentation or otherwise **falsifiable through empirical observation**.

## What makes theory valuable?

**Q:** What do we mean by "good in theory, but lousy in practice?"

--

- Such statements are misplaced, as theory's only value is in **how well it works in practice!**
- Let's not say this anymore?


--

## Factors to consider?

**Refutability** 

- The theory could, in principle, be wrong. Otherwise, it is without value.
- Economists/scientists seek to make statements that could be wrong, but are repeatedly shown to be consistent with the facts.

- Such statements are misplaced, as theory's only value is in **how well it works in practice!**

## Factors to consider?

**Predictive power** 

- A theory is valuable insofar as it predicts behavior well.

**Simplicity** 

- *All else equal*, simpler theory is more valuable.

# Theory in a data-driven world?

**Caveat 1: A theory does not imply its converse.**

Observing .hi-pink[B] does not guarantee that .hi-purple[A] is true. **Something else could have caused** .hi-pink[B]**.**

- Example: Just because .pink[you don't have a headache] doesn't mean that .purple[you took an Advil].
- Example: Just because .pink[you improved your exam score] doesn't mean that .purple[your attendance improved]. <br>
    

--

**Caveat 2: Science cannot prove that a theory is true.**

At best, science fails to refute a theory's postulates or predictions.

- Example: We will not prove that social assistance programs ("welfare") are good. Nor will we prove that social assistance programs are bad.
