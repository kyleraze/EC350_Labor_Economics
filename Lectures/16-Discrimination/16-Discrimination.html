# Discrimination

## **Theory**

Economics has a lot to say about discrimination in the labor market and other settings..super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]]

While they do not explain all forms of discrimination,.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;]] the two most common economic models of discrimination are

1. **Taste-based discrimination:** Prejudiced employers willingly sacrifice resources to avoid contact with workers from certain groups.

2. **Statistical discrimination:** Unprejudiced employers use group characteristics to make inferences about an individual worker's productivity.

# Taste-based discrimination

Models of **taste-based discrimination**.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] posit that **prejudice** (or **animus**) causes discrimination in the labor market. 
- **The premise?** Some economic agents would **willingly sacrifice resources to avoid contact** with certain groups of people. 

.footnote[.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] Developed by Gary Becker in [The Economics of Discrimination](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/to8ro2/CP71244526180001451), *University of Chicago Press* (1957).]

### **Setup** 

Two groups of equally productive workers: 
1. **In-group** workers (*e.g.,* White workers) who receive the wage `\(w_\text{W}\)`.
2. **Out-group** workers (*e.g.,* Black workers) who receive the wage `\(w_\text{B}\)`.

### **Setup** 

A **discrimination coefficient** `\(d\)` captures the **disutility of out-group contact** for three types of prejudiced economic agents:
1. **Employers** who perceive hiring out-group workers as `\(d \times 100\)`-percent more costly than `\(w_\text{B}\)`.
2. **Co-workers** who perceive their wage as `\(d \times 100\)`-percent lower when working with the out-group.
3. **Customers** who perceive prices as `\(d \times 100\)`-percent when buying from an out-group seller.

---
# Taste-based discrimination

## **Employer discrimination**

Since both groups of workers are **equally productive**, they are **perfect substitutes**.

- The level of output simply depends on the number of workers: `\(q = f(E_\text{W} + E_\text{B})\)`.
- A firm with 25 in-group workers and 25 out-groups **produces the same output** as a firm with 50 in-group workers or a firm with 50 out-group workers.
- `\(\text{MP}_E\)` does not depend on in-group/out-group status!


--

**Q:** How would a non-discriminatory employer maximize profit?

--

- **A:** By hiring from the cheaper group of workers until `\(w = \text{VMP}_E\)`.
    - If `\(w_\text{W} &gt; w_\text{B}\)`, then hire `\(E^*_\text{B}\)` out-group workers such that `\(w_\text{B} = \text{VMP}_E\)`.
    - If `\(w_\text{B} &gt; w_\text{W}\)`, then hire `\(E^*_\text{W}\)` in-group workers such that `\(w_\text{W} = \text{VMP}_E\)`.



--

Going forward, we will assume that `\(w_\text{W} &gt; w_\text{B}\)`.

## **Employer discrimination**

Non-discriminatory employers simply **hire out-group workers**.

- **Why?** Both groups of workers are equally productive (*i.e.,* same `\(\text{VMP}_E\)`), but out-group labor is cheaper (*i.e.,* `\(w_\text{B} &lt; w_\text{W}\)`).

]

---
# Taste-based discrimination

## **Employer discrimination**

Discriminatory employers perceive the cost of employing an out-group worker as `\(w_\text{B}(1 + d)\)`.

- If `\(w_\text{B}=10\)` and `\(d=0.1\)`, then the employer will act as though the out-group worker costs `\(10(1 + 0.1) = 11\)`.
- The "utility-adjusted" cost of hiring an out-group worker exceeds the actual cost!

--

**The result?** Segregation! A discriminatory employer will

- Hire only in-group workers if `\(w_\text{B}(1 + d) &gt; w_\text{W}\)`
- Hire only out-group workers if `\(w_\text{B}(1 + d) &lt; w_\text{W}\)`

## **Employer discrimination**

**Case 1:** Employer hires only in-group workers.

- The employer **overpays for labor!**
    - `\(w_\text{W} &gt; w_\text{B}\)`, but `\(\text{VMP}_E\)` is the same for both groups of workers.
- Because in-group labor is relatively expensive, the employer **hires too few workers!**.

**Case 2:** Employer hires only out-group workers.

- The employer **hires too few workers!** 
    - Actual hiring `\(E^*_\text{B}\)` occurs where `\(w_\text{B}(1+d)= \text{VMP}_E\)`, even though the actual wage is `\(w_\text{B}\)`.
- The employer **pays the out-group worker too little!**
    - The marginal worker receives less than her contribution, as `\(w_\text{B} &lt; \text{VMP}_E = w_\text{B}(1+d)\)`.
]

# Taste-based discrimination

## **Employer discrimination**

**Q:** Is discrimination profitable?

--

**A:** No! 

- To indulge their distaste for out-group workers, **prejudiced employers sacrifice profit!**
- By hiring too few workers, discriminatory employers fail to operate efficiently!


--

**The implication?** In a perfectly competitive market, non-discriminating employers will eventually drive discriminating employers out of business.

- In-group and out-group wages will eventually equalize.


--

**Q.sub[1]:** Are wage differentials actually decreasing? &lt;br&gt; **Q.sub[2]:** Are markets actually perfectly competitive?

---
# Taste-based discrimination

## **Co-worker discrimination**

Suppose instead that employers are unprejudiced, but in-group workers dislike working with out-group workers.

- In-group workers receive `\(w_\text{W}\)`, but act as though they're paid `\(w_\text{W}(1-d)\)`.


--

To offset the disutility of working with out-group workers, the employer would have to pay in-group workers an additional `\(w_\text{W} \times d\)` dollars.

- The total wage paid for an in-group worker would rise to `\(w_\text{W}(1+d)\)`.
- If the marginal productivity of in-group and out-group workers is the same, and there are no discriminatory employers, then `\(w_\text{W} = w_\text{B} &lt; w_\text{W}(1+d)\)`.

**The result?** Segregation that persists *even with perfect competition*, but no wage differential.


---
# Taste-based discrimination

## **Customer discrimination**

Now suppose that workers and employers are unprejudiced, but customers dislike buying from the out-group.

- A prejudiced customer faces the actual market price `\(p\)`, but feels as though they are paying `\(p(1+d)\)`.


--

An employer with out-group workers would have to reduce `\(p\)` to compensate prejudiced customers.

- This assumes that the employer is unable to reallocate out-group workers away from customer-facing roles within the firm.


--

**The result?** The employer decreases wages for out-group workers, creating a wage differential that persists *even with perfect competition*.

---
# Statistical discrimination

Models of **statistical discrimination**.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] posit that discrimination arises from employer **uncertainty** about difficult-to-observe productive attributes of workers. 

.footnote[.super[.hi-pink[&lt;span&gt;&amp;#8224;&lt;/span&gt;]] Developed by Edmund Phelps in [The Statistical Theory of Racism and Sexism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1806107), *The American Economic Review* (1972), and Kenneth Arrow in "The Theory of Discrimination" in Orley Ashenfelter and Albert Rees, eds., [Discrimination in Labor Markets](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/to8ro2/CP71344164760001451), *Princeton University Press* (1973).]

**The premise?** Employers use a worker's race or gender to make inferences about the worker's productivity.

--

- In these models, **employers are unprejudiced**&amp;mdash;they do not have a taste for discrimination.
- **The basis for discrimination?** Group differences in past performance (*e.g.,* achievement gaps).
    - When considering job applicants with the same observable productive traits, but different group characteristics (*e.g.,* race), employers will often rely on the **past performance of groups** to predict **difficult-to-observe productive traits of individuals**. 
    - Discrimination occurs when the employer systematically favors applicants from higher-productivity groups.

---
# Statistical discrimination

Employers can test workers for productive traits, but it is unlikely that a test can perfectly predict productivity.

To set a worker's wage, an employer uses a weighted average of the worker's test score and the average score of the group to which the worker belongs: `$$w = \alpha T + (1-\alpha)\overline{T}$$`

--

- `\(T\)` is the individual's test score.
- `\(\overline{T}\)` is the group average.
- `\(0 \leq \alpha \leq 1\)` represents how well the test measures productivity.
    - If `\(\alpha = 1\)`, then the test provides a perfect measure of individual productivity and `\(w=T\)`.
    - If `\(\alpha = 0\)`, then the test provides no meaningful measure of individual productivity and `\(w=\overline{T}\)`.
