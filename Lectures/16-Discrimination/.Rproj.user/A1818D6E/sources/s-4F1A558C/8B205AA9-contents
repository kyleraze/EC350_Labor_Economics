# Discrimination

## **Theory**

Economics has a lot to say about discrimination in the labor market and other settings..super[.hi-pink[<span>&#8224;</span>]]

1. **Taste-based discrimination:** Prejudiced employers willingly sacrifice resources to avoid contact with workers from certain groups.

2. **Statistical discrimination:** Unprejudiced employers use group characteristics to make inferences about an individual worker's productivity.

[Why do agents discriminate? (taste-based vs. statistical + shoutout to sociology)]

# Taste-based discrimination

Models of **taste-based discrimination**.super[.hi-pink[<span>&#8224;</span>]] posit that **prejudice** (or **animus**) causes discrimination in the labor market. 
- **The premise?** Some economic agents would **willingly sacrifice resources to avoid contact** with certain groups of people. 

.footnote[.super[.hi-pink[<span>&#8224;</span>]] Developed by Gary Becker in [The Economics of Discrimination](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/to8ro2/CP71244526180001451), *University of Chicago Press* (1957).]

### **Setup** 

Two groups of equally productive workers: 
1. **In-group** workers (*e.g.,* White workers) who receive the wage $w_\text{W}$.
2. **Out-group** workers (*e.g.,* Black workers) who receive the wage $w_\text{B}$.

### **Setup** 

A **discrimination coefficient** $d$ captures the **disutility of out-group contact** for three types of prejudiced economic agents:
1. **Employers** who perceive hiring out-group workers as $d \times 100$-percent more costly than $w_\text{B}$.
2. **Co-workers** who perceive their wage as $d \times 100$-percent lower when working with the out-group.
3. **Customers** who perceive prices as $d \times 100$-percent when buying from an out-group seller.

# Taste-based discrimination

## **Employer discrimination**

Since both groups of workers are **equally productive**, they are **perfect substitutes**.

- The level of output simply depends on the number of workers: $q = f(E_\text{W} + E_\text{B})$.
- A firm with 25 in-group workers and 25 out-groups **produces the same output** as a firm with 50 in-group workers or a firm with 50 out-group workers.
- $\text{MP}_E$ does not depend on in-group/out-group status!


--

**Q:** How would a non-discriminatory employer maximize profit?

--

- **A:** By hiring from the cheaper group of workers until $w = \text{VMP}_E$.
    - If $w_\text{W} > w_\text{B}$, then hire $E^*_\text{B}$ out-group workers such that $w_\text{B} = \text{VMP}_E$.
    - If $w_\text{B} > w_\text{W}$, then hire $E^*_\text{W}$ in-group workers such that $w_\text{W} = \text{VMP}_E$.
